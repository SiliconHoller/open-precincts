# VoterWatch Solution

The VoterWatch project was the original .Net software, written in Visual Studio 2010, for this concept.  The source is included in this project as a reference for developers, and is not intended to be developed in an ongoing manner.

## Caveat

However, the entire focus is on the "solution" (capability-wise, not the software), not the implementation.  If a capability can be implemented faster/easier in another language or development environment, then parts of this project may be revisited.
